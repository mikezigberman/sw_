# (sw_eja) Semester work on the subject of Enterprise Java

## Semester work

The theme of the work is arbitrary. At least two persistent entities bound by at least the OneToMany/ManyToOne association must be used in the data part. Business logic must be accessible by REST service. For the service, create a client in any technology.

If the contact examination is resumed and the requirement to maintain 2m distances is lifted, the semester papers will be presented during the contact examination. Otherwise, the semester papers will be handed over electrically and must contain:

<ol>
  <li>Source codes</li>
  <li>Presentation video to the extent in which the work would be presented by contact (about 5 min):
    <ul>
      <li>topic of work</li>
      <li>sample use</li>
      <li>application architecture i.e. description of individual components (presentation, business, communication, etc.)
</li>
      <li>brief description of used libraries</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Executable shape (uber / fat jar) or build and run instructions</li>
</ol>
